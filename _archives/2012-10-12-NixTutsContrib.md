This is the start of a series of tutorials about how to contribute to NixTuts!

###Git

Learn how to use Git efficiently at [Using Git to Contribute](/nixtuts/NixTutsContrib-Git.html). You are recommended to use [prose.io](http://prose.io) if this is your first time in encounter with GitHub. It is **much** easier to use than many other ways to edit our stuff. Since it's self-explanatory we won't provide a tutorial for it - but if you want to, you can always do so. :D 

###Writing posts
