###1) Linux forms the backbone of Hollywood's animated films.
   
A common myth is that Linux has yet to establish its presence in the film industry. In fact, more than 95% of the servers used by Hollywood studios for Animation films have GNU/Linux installed. The Oscar-winning visual effects of the Titanic by James Cameroon came from a Linux cluster. Avatar was also the first film shot entirely in 3D applications using free software on Linux Machines.
   
###2) Linux programmers are not "isolated" in the world
  
Over 75% of the code developed for the Linux Kernel came from private sector developers. Industry companies such as Intel, Google, IBM, AMD, Sun Microsystems, Asus, HP, Dell, Oracle, Analog Devices, Novell or Red Hat helped to develop applications, add on to the core or pre-install Linux in their machines.

###3) Why is there /sbin/, /usr/bin and /bin?

When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie upgraded from a PDP-7 (on which they created UNIX in 1969) to a PDP-11 in 1971, they had two 1.5MB hard disk. The first disk contained the operating system while the second contained their user config. This second disk was mounted at /usr (/home was not invented yet). Soon, the operating system grew too large for the first disk and had to spill over to the second disk. As a result, they copied the system directory structure onto this second disk under /usr. When they had another disk, they moved all the user config to the third disk under /home. They were forced to come up with rules, such that mount couldn't be in /usr/bin since it was needed to mount the second disk (/usr). In the end, Linux ended up with this weird structure.

###4) More than 90% of the world's most powerful supercomputers run linux.

The top 10 most powerful super-computers of the world are powered by linux. Linux's dominance on super-computers has gone to such an extent the more than 90% of the super-computers which exist today run on linux. The penetration of Linux in data centers has risen significantly. More than 33% of the world runs on linux servers compared to 7.3% does so in a Microsoft operating system. Google's servers run on Linux, the server hosting the White-House website (done in Drupal) run on Linux.

###5) How did Tux (a penguin) become the mascot of Linux?

Linus Torvalds was bitten by a Little Penguin on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium, Canberra, Australia. Interestingly, it went on to become the official Linux mascot by the name "Tux"(named by James Hughes), which as some say is an abbreviation of (T)orvald's (U)ni(x), whereas some others say  is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which springs to mind when one sees a penguin. Tux was originally designed as a submission for a Linux logo contest. Three such competitions took place; Tux won none of them. This is why Tux is formally known as the Linux mascot and not the logo.

###6) The Registration of Linux Trademark.

Serious tensions arose when William Della Croce Jr.Linux registered as a trademark in the United States of America in 1994 and began to borrow money to Linux by the use of its trademark. Torvalds took this character to trial and recovered to register the Linux trademark in 1997.

###7) The GNU Project motivated Torvalds.

The GNU Project initiated by Richard Stallman had no drivers and kernel back in 1991. That's what led to Linus Torvalds to address the Linus Kernel development. Otherwise, Torvalds had not been put to work on that.

###8) Linux spread quickly in spite of oppositions.

According to The Register, Microsoft had accumulated $421 million cost of fighting the spread of Linux in 2002. Many such attempts from various competitors were seen. In spite of all this, Linux not just survived, it thrived.
