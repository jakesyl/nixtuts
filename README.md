NixTuts is a site filled with tutorials. We aim to help *nix users, spread knowledge of *nix and help the Open Source/Free Software community!

Thank you for your donations!

## Build System

We use Travis-Ci to build and push to our server automatically whenever someone pushes to Git.
For more info, see our [Travis Repository Info](https://travis-ci.org/nixtuts/site),
as well as our [travis YAML file](.travis.yml) and [build scripts](\_scripts).

## Contributing

Our site is a static site, generated by Jekyll, so ensure you are familiar with Jekyll.

Firstly, fork our repository on Git, and clone your copy of it:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nixtuts/site.git
```

You'll need to install some packages.

For Debian, execute this:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9-dev bundler python-pygments
```

For Fedora, execute this:

```bash
$ sudo yum install ruby-devel rubygem-bundler python-pygments
```

Next, pull in dependencies by running Bundler:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Now, you can modify to your heart's content.

To build our site, just run:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ jekyll build
```
The files are now in `_site` and you can view them. If you wish to get a webserver up instead, execute this:

```bash
$ jekyll server
```

And if you want it to automatically build everytime a change is detected:

```bash
$ jekyll server -w
```

Finally, make a commit with the new update (on a new branch first!), create a pull request, and we'll try to add it in.
If you want to be a contributor, send in a(few) pull request(s), then ask @wei2912.

## Workflow for contributors

Create a new branch for something you wish to do, then make your edits. Once done, merge the branches and do a `git rebase -i` to get your commits arranged neatly. Once that's done, go ahead and do a `git push`.

## Archives

Posts that are suspected of copyright violations, are irrelevant or do not meet the guidelines are to be put in _archives. You may use them for reference purposes or attempt to rewrite them.

## Pulling commits from binaries

If you wish to pull commits from the binaries repository, use this command:

```bash
$ git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```

## Headers

To keep things neat, please do not use header tag `h1`, or `#` in Markdown..

## Modernizr

We use a customized version of Modernizr. The build link is available at `_assets/js/depend/modernizr.js`. You may customize it to select any features you may require, than update this with a new file.
