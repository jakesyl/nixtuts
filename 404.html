<h1>Hmm...</h1>
<p>Sorry for that, we can't find what you're looking for. Here's a couple of options you may want to choose:</p>
<p>1. Conduct a nice little Google Search if you know what you're looking for. Maybe we restructured our site.</p>
{% include snippets/searchbar.html %}
<p>2. Return to the homepage!</p>
<a href="/index.html">Here you go - back to the homepage</a>
<p>3. Report to us about the broken link you followed. You should always do so if the link you went to was on our site.</p>
<a href="mailto:nixtuts.supp0rt@gmail.com">Our email - feel free to report a broken link.</a>
<h2>And to clarify...</h2>
<p>No, you didn't crash our server. Not that easy.</p>
