summary: Git is a version control system widely used by many. In this tutorial, we guide you through using Git for your own programming projects.
--- 

## Firstly, what exactly is Git?

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) is a **version control system** created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the creator of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) as well (which is the operating system you're most likely using right now, as you should know). However, what exactly is a **version control system**?

Version control systems help programmers manage changes to their code. It helps to streamline development, enable development with other developers and contributers, allow a commit to be reverted easily etc.

## Why Git?

I interviewed a couple of people on IRC.

Here's the first interview with clem, the project leader of [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/).

	<wei2912> clem, why do you find git awesome? :)
	<clem> I use git to detect changes... I git init my ~, click buttons... and I see what the tools changed :)
	<clem> I use git to take notes... so I don't need to write down the changes I made myself
	<clem> I use git to go back to previous versions of my work, so if I make a mistake, it's no big deal
	<clem> I use git to exchange and work with others... etc etc..
	<clem> there's a lot of common use cases for not only devs but users in general
	<clem> that's why I need version control systems...
	<clem> now why git in particular?
	<clem> first, it's standard, everybody uses git
	<clem> it's the most popular toy right now
	<clem> second it comes with awesome web tools like github and all
	<clem> third it's decentralized.. which means you can bring it home, on your USB key, work offline, branches and forks are as important as each others and it's just brilliant to exchange stuff
	<clem> everybody's work is compatible
	<clem> two forks can merge together without needing anything from the original branch
	* wei2912 agrees strongly about taking notes, reverting, everybody using it, decentralization and ease of merging :D
	<clem> two co workers could actually meet in a cafe, offline from the Internet, merge their respective work they did at home, end up with a version they like and bring it to the office together to merge with the rest of the team, in which some of the guys would have changed stuff at home too...
	<clem> it's completely brilliant :)
	<wei2912> yeh
	<wei2912> IMO linus did do a great job :)
	<clem> it's kinda like having all the pros of the version control without the cons
	* clem remembers clearcase...
	<clem> central clearcase servers hosted in sweden... encrypted HDDs... what a nightmear that was :)
	<wei2912> there's another important reason as well
	<wei2912> it's free of charge and open source
	<clem> yes

And the second interview with [Subsentient](https://github.com/Subsentient), the guy who own the server which this site is hosted on:

	<Subsentient> wei2912: It seems to be the most mature and stable version control system around. In a relatively short time it's become unrivaled in stability, usability, and reliability.
	<wei2912> true

### And my own personal view...

Git provides an easy way to manage a project. It is powerful yet simple and can (have) been used to do loads of stuff. Git can be used for a variety of things; GitHub recently launched [government.github.com](https://github.com/blog/1657-introducing-government-github-com), allowing governments to have a platform to collaborate on policies.

Git is free and open source. Anyone can use it free of charge, free of restrictions. Git is also decentralized. What does decentralization mean? Simply put, rather than a large repository which everyone updates, everyone has their own version of the repository. As `clem` said, two coworkers could meet in a cafe, merge their work at home and bring it to the office to merge with the office repository. They don't need any Internet connection to do this and the best part is, other workers can do so as well at the same time.

## Installation

Git can be installed through multiple ways. It is available in many package repositories.

For Debian-based systems, the following should work:

{% highlight bash %}
$ apt-get install git
{% endhighlight %}

Let's tell Git our name and email so that commits can be properly labelled.

{% highlight bash %}
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
{% endhighlight %}

You should create a [GitHub](http://github.com) account as well, with the same email address. GitHub is the primary Git repository hosting service we're using in this tutorial.

## Repositories

A Git repository is basically a folder with your code in it. Firstly, let's create a directory called `TestGit/`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir TestGit/
$ cd TestGit/
{% endhighlight %}

Inside this directory, we will initialize the repository.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/wei2912/TestGit/.git/
{% endhighlight %}

A new subdirectory, `.git`, will be created in `TestGit/`. Let's see if it's inside.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ls -a
.  ..  .git
{% endhighlight %}

If it's inside, you've successfully created a new Git repository.

## Using `git status`

`git status` gives us useful information about the repository. Let's look at an example.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
{% endhighlight %}

What do all of these mean? Let's go through this step by step.

`git status` says we're "On branch master". What exactly does "branch master" mean?

In Git, branches are similar to different versions of code. A branch is created from the master branch (the "root" of the tree) and users can then edit the code in that branch without affecting the code in the master branch. When required, that branch can then be merged into the master branch.

We'll cover more about branches in another tutorial. Meanwhile, here's an image of the network of branches of [our repository](https://github.com/nixtuts/site/) at GitHub.

![Branches of nixtuts/site in GitHub](/img/programming/UsingGit/gitbranches.png)

Now, moving on to commits. Commits are records of changes to code, text, whatever you're storing in the repository. After modifying files, you would want to create a commit to record the changes made to these files.

The initial commit is the first commit in a Git repository, as its name suggests.

## Creating your initial commit

Now, let's go ahead and create an initial commit. It's a good idea to add in a README and a LICENSE file to inform viewers what this repository contains and its license.

GitHub has [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) support for READMEs, allowing users to format their READMEs. To enable this feature, we'll create a README file with the file extension ".md" (stands for Markdown).

{% highlight bash %}
$ touch README.md
{% endhighlight %}

Go ahead and edit README.md with your favourite text editor. Here's what I included:

    # Hi!
    
    Welcome to my respoitory, TestGit. This is a repository for me to try out Git. There's nothing much here.

A `#` in Markdown stands for `h1` or heading 1. Heading 1 is the largest heading.

After you're done, proceed to create your LICENSE file as well. The LICENSE file is responsible for telling users what the LICENSE of the program is.

As I am pro-public domain (and there's nothing useful in our repository), I'll place this repository in public domain.

{% highlight bash %}
$ touch LICENSE
{% endhighlight %}

Now, add this into LICENSE:

	This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

	Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or
	distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled
	binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any
	means.

	In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors
	of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the
	software to the public domain. We make this dedication for the benefit
	of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and
	successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of
	relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this
	software under copyright law.

	THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
	EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
	IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
	OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
	ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
	OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

	For more information, please refer to <http://unlicense.org/>

If all went well, you should have the following:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ls
LICENSE  README.md
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	LICENSE
#	README.md
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
{% endhighlight %}

Now, there's something new in `git status` - "Untracked files". What are untracked files? They are new files that are not present in the current commit. As this is the initial commit, anything you add will be untracked.

Let's go ahead and add these files.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git add LICENSE README.md
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   LICENSE
#	new file:   README.md
#
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you can see that `git status` reports that there are "Changes to be committed". These files are called staged files and there is no commit that records the changes to these files. We shall do that now.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git commit -m "Add LICENSE and README files."
[master (root-commit) e58d155] Add LICENSE and README files.
 2 files changed, 27 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 LICENSE
 create mode 100644 README.md
{% endhighlight %}

The `-m` flag means message. Our commit message is "Add LICENSE and README files.". A commit message is used to summarize up your changes to your files. A good commit message is short and concise but yet precise and specific.

Insertions represents the number of lines inserted into the document. As you will see later, deletions represents the number of lines deleted from the document.

## Creating another commit

Now that we're done with our initial commit, let's create another commit. The statement "There's nothing much here." in our README.md is no longer true, so we'll remove that in our commit.

Open up the file with your favourite editor and remove that line. You should get this:

	# Hi!

	Welcome to my respoitory, TestGit. This is a repository for me to try out Git.

Also, we will add a reminder to view the LICENSE file. You should get this:

	# Hi!

	Welcome to my respoitory, TestGit. This is a repository for me to try out Git.

	Please view the LICENSE file.

Okay, we're done.

## `git diff`

`git diff` shows you the changes you've made to the repository ever since the last commit.

If you followed the above, you should get this:

	$ git diff
	diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
	index a5dfca5..5cb7701 100644
	--- a/README.md
	+++ b/README.md
	@@ -1,3 +1,5 @@
	 # Hi!
	 
	-Welcome to my respoitory, TestGit. This is a repository for me to try out Git. Th
	+Welcome to my respoitory, TestGit. This is a repository for me to try out Git.
	+
	+Please view the LICENSE file.
	(END)

This opens up `less` which can be closed by pressing the key `q`. `less` allows you to scroll up and down with the arrow keys, but as the differences in this file is only a few lines, you can't scroll down. Hence, the `(END)` message.

If you're interested in finding out what exactly does this whole thing mean, look at [diff - Unified format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format). Simply said, `-` represents the deletion of a line and `+` represents the addition of a line.

Now that we're satisfied, let's press the key `q` to close the `less` window.

## Committing the change

These commands should do:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Update README.md"
[master 18547ca] Update README.md
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see from the `git diff` output, it corresponds with the output from `git commit`. 3 lines were inserted and 1 line was deleted.

## `git log`

`git log` allows us to take a look at the history of the repository.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git log
commit 18547ca352463c57b53ebcec6e1ce6218cb2161a
Author: wei2912 <wei2912.supp0rt@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 25 17:45:04 2013 +0800

    Update README.md

commit e58d155c173618b15514b83d0f625603fd9c2486
Author: wei2912 <wei2912.supp0rt@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 25 17:33:37 2013 +0800

    Add LICENSE and README files.
{% endhighlight %}

This shows the commits made in order of most recent to least recent, as well as the authors and the time they were made. This is useful for going through the history of a repository.

## Pushing to GitHub

We're going to push the repository to GitHub. To do that, we'll need to create a new repository in GitHub first.

At [GitHub](https://github.com), click on "New repository".

![New repository](/img/programming/UsingGit/github_createrepo.png)

Fill up the details. The repository name **must be the same**.

![New repository](/img/programming/UsingGit/github_createrepo2.png)

You should get this:

![Newly created repository](/img/programming/UsingGit/github_repo.png)

Look at the URL underneath "Quick setup". For me, the URL is [https://github.com/wei2912/TestGit](https://github.com/wei2912/TestGit).

Now, type:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/wei2912/TestGit
$ git push -u origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': wei2912
Password for 'https://wei2912@github.com': 
Counting objects: 7, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 1.32 KiB, done.
Total 7 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/wei2912/TestGit
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
{% endhighlight %}

Replace my URL with yours.

This pushes, or uploads, the repositories onto the URL origin at master. You can see that a new branch was created.

If you've done all this correctly, you should see this now (refresh the page):

![Pushed repository](/img/programming/UsingGit/github_repo2.png)

## The end

That's all for the basics of Git! We'll be coming up with more tutorials about Git quite soon. These tutorials will address the more advanced aspects of Git, such as branches, rebasing and etc.

Here're some resources:

* [git-scm - official Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8) - a rather interesting talk
* [try.github.io](http://try.github.io) - GitHub's site meant for users who want to try out/learn Git.

**EDIT**: Yes, I made a typo in the README.md file. I won't correct the typo and instead will leave this as an exercise to the reader :)
