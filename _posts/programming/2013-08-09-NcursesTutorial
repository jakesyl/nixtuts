# Installing Ncurses on CodeBlocks

First of all, you will need the CodeBlocks IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment). To install, simply go to your package manager and search for the latest version of CodeBlocks. Or you can open up a terminal and use aptitude:
    sudo apt-get install codeblocks

Next up is getting Ncurses. The latest version is available on: [http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses) (At the time of writing it is ncurses-5.9.tar.gz), put it in your Home folder.
When you have downloaded the tarball extract it with tar:
    tar -xzvf ncurses-5.9.tar.gz

Now is the time to configure and make the file, go to the extracted ncurses-5.9 folder in the terminal and run these commands:
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Now comes the last part, configuring CodeBlocks to look for Ncurses. Start up CodeBlocks and go to Settings > Compiler and debugger, then go to the tab named ' Linker settings' and add /home/[yourname]/ncurses-5.9/lib/libncurses_g.a and /home/jeroen/ncurses-5.9/lib/libncurses.a (Image here). Go to the next tab called ' Search Directories' and add /home/jeroen/ncurses-5.9/ to Compiler, Linker and Resource compiler (Images here). You are now done with part 1!
