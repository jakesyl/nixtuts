title: LTdesign Program - Designing A Better Site

status: program

launch: 20 November 2012
close: 01 January 2013

summary: The first LinuxTuts (now NixTuts) program we are launching - LTdesign! These first few days you may have seen the design change rapidly. We've been experimenting (derping)around with the design interface of the site and tried to customize it for several devices. It is now time to enroll your help in testing the site design!

<p>We've been trying to enhance the design of the site and we've got it to a stable point. Now it's time for you all to test it out.</p>

<p>I (wei2912)'ve tested my own work under Firefox Nightly, which is the most up-to-date version of Firefox. It works for me - but I need more people to test out. Most likely few people would use Firefox Nightly - probably Firefox Stable or even an older version. So... here's the video:</p>

<p>And now it's time for participation.</p>

<p>Make sure you are in the right layout before you click on any button. We'll automatically report based on your height and width. Check the page for any visual artefacts.</p>

<a id="working" class="button">It's working!</a>
<a id="not-working" class="button">It's not working...</a>

<p>You require JavaScript for this.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
// set the user agent
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("#useragent").text(navigator.userAgent);
});
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
var clicked = false;

$("#working").bind("click", function() {
    launch(true);
});

$("#not-working").bind("click", function() {
    launch(false);
});

function launch(working) {
    var link = "";
    if (working) {
        link = "mailto:linuxtuts.supp0rt@gmail.com"
             + "?subject=" + escape("New Query")
             + "&body=" + escape("Working! | User agent: " + navigator.userAgent + " | W x H: " + $(window).width() + " x " + $(window).height());
    }
    else {
        link = "mailto:linuxtuts.supp0rt@gmail.com"
             + "?subject=" + escape("New Query")
             + "&body=" + escape("Not working. | User agent: " + navigator.userAgent + " | W x H: " + $(window).width() + " x " + $(window).height()) + " | Issues:";
    }
    window.location.href = link;
    
    alert("Thanks for your feedback! You should see your email client popping up soon...");
    return false;
