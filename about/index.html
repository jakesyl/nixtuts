<h1>About</h1>

<p>NixTuts started from an IRC channel at spotchat.org, in the year of 2012. Most of us participated in a couple of help channels, namely the Linux Mint help channels at Spotchat. We decided to create a place where we could help newbies by inviting them to this place and teaching them basic Linux knowledge.</p>

<p>Eventually, this involved into a website, when we thought: why not just create a website and link there?</p>

<p>From then on, we were commited to creating quality tutorials for the *nix community.</p>

<p>You're welcome to join us! Just visit us at any of our IRC channels as stated below.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>NixTuts stuff</h2>

<p>Q: What does "NixTuts" mean?</p>
<p>A: *nix Tutorials in full form :D We refer to tutorials as "tuts" too. *nix is commonly used in IRC channels as a reference to Unix-like systems.</p>

<h2>IRC</h2>

<p>Q: Sooooo many channels? Which one?</p>
<p>A: Choose the channel that is in a server that you use. If no such server exists, join the main channel.</p>

<p>Q: I've been banned from the channels! What should I do?</p>
<p>A: We usually ban people with a reason and thus if you are banned you should see a reason. Any ban without a reason is considered invalid and will be removed. If you still have a reason... try entering other channels and explaining your reason. But keep it civil, else we'll ban you. If we really don't want you to enter, look for 1) an abnormal ban that causes auto kick 2) widespread ban. In most cases this will not happen.</p>

<h2>Contributing to NixTuts</h2>

<p>Q: How could I contribute to NixTuts?</p>
<p>A: We're currently working on a new tutorial about contributing to NixTuts as well as a wiki for documentation.</p>
