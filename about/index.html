<p>NixTuts started from an IRC channel at spotchat.org. Most of us participated in a couple of help channels, namely the Linux Mint help channels at Spotchat. We decided to create a place where we could help newbies by inviting them to this place and teaching them basic Linux knowledge.</p>

<p>Eventually, this involved into a website, when we thought: why not just create a website and link there?</p>

<p>From then on, we were commited to creating quality tutorials for the *nix community.</p>

<p>You're welcome to join us! Just visit us at any of our IRC channels as stated below.</p>
